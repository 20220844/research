Face-recognition

What is Python used for? I was asking myself, that is my concern. Then, I searched Google.

Python can be usde for 
AI and machine learning, 
Data analytics, 
Data visualisation, 
Programming applications, 
Web development, 
Game development, 
Language development, 
Finance, 
SEO (search engine optmisation), 
Design.

Suddenly, "Face-recognition" came into view. That is an interesting project which I desired to give insight into.
