Face-recognition

What is Python used for? I was asking myself, that is my concern. Then, I searched Google.

Python can be usde for:   
.AI and machine learning,  
.Data analytics,  
.Data visualisation, 
.Programming applications,  
.Web development,   
.Game development,   
.Language development,   
.Finance,   
.SEO (search engine optmisation),   
.Design  

Suddenly, "Face-recognition" came into view. That is an interesting project which I desired to give insight into.
It is a machine learning model that recofnizes the persons from an image.
In this project, we use the face_recognition API and OpenCV.

Tools and Libraries  
*Python-3.x  
*cv2-4.5.2  
*numpy-1.20.3  
*face_recognition-1.3.0 

Steps to develop face recognition model  
1. Prepare the dataset - to create 2 directories, "train" and "test". "train" is to save the images you picked, "test" is for you to choose a picture containning all the images in "train".  
2. Train the model  
3. Test the model on the test dataset  
4. Python face recognitionk output
